# Weather Dashboard
## Description

Task: To create a Weather Dashboard using the OpenWeather One Call API.  The use will input a city name and the page will render the weather conditiions for the current day and also for the next 5 days. Each city will be saved as a button and show on the page even after reload.  It's intended use is for travellers who need to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I plan their travels accordingly.

## What I learned
During the completion of this task, I learned:
- How to call a third party api and set parameters
- How to include parameters within the function, before calling fetch
- How to carry data forward from one fetch function, into a second fetch function
- How to clear the page of the previous search results, before displaying the new search results
- How to restrict duplicated button generation when search and city buttons selected
- A clearer understanding of localStorage set & get
- How back-ticks are used
- That Bootstrap is great, but I definitely need some practice!
- When working with multiple cards, just have the container in html and dynamically create elements in js
- A little bit of emmet
